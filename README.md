# golang
Go is the first backend programming language I've worked with, and second programming language overall. I previously had more starter projects from the bootcamp where I first started learning Go, but I have since deleted them. projects are separated by type (executable vs package) and organized by start date from newest-oldest, and their complexity should generally follow this order. happy coding :)
